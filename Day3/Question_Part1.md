# Day 3: Mull It Over  

---

## Problem Overview  

The **North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop** computers are having issues due to **corrupted memory**. The goal of the corrupted program is to execute **multiplication instructions** of the form:  

```
mul(X,Y)
```  

Where:  
- `X` and `Y` are numbers (1-3 digits each).  
- The valid format is **exactly** `mul(X,Y)`.  

### Corruption Rules  

The memory is corrupted with invalid characters or malformed instructions, such as:  
- `mul(4*`  
- `mul[3,7]`  
- `mul ( 2 , 4 )`  

These **should be ignored**. Only properly formatted `mul(X,Y)` instructions are valid.  

---

## Example Input  

Consider the corrupted memory:  

```
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```  

### Extraction of Valid Instructions  

| **Valid `mul` Instruction** | **Result** |  
|-----------------------------|------------|  
| `mul(2,4)`                  | `2 * 4 = 8` |  
| `mul(5,5)`                  | `5 * 5 = 25` |  
| `mul(11,8)`                 | `11 * 8 = 88` |  
| `mul(8,5)`                  | `8 * 5 = 40` |  

---

### Total Calculation  

The sum of the valid results is:  

```
8 + 25 + 88 + 40 = 161
```

---

## Task  

Scan the corrupted memory for **valid `mul` instructions** and **add up all their results**. What is the total?
