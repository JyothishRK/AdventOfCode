# Part Two  

---

## Updated Scenario  

As you go to win the **first prize,** you discover that the **claw is nowhere near where you expected it would be.** This is due to a **unit conversion error** in your measurements.  

The **position of every prize** is actually **10,000,000,000,000 higher** on **both the X and Y axis.**  

---

## Adjustment  

You now **add 10,000,000,000,000** to the **X and Y position of every prize.** After this change, the example would now look like this:  

---

### Example Adjustments  

- **Button A:** X+94, Y+34  
- **Button B:** X+22, Y+67  
- **Prize:** X=10,000,000,008,400, Y=10,000,000,005,400  

---

- **Button A:** X+26, Y+66  
- **Button B:** X+67, Y+21  
- **Prize:** X=10,000,000,012,748, Y=10,000,000,012,176  

---

- **Button A:** X+17, Y+86  
- **Button B:** X+84, Y+37  
- **Prize:** X=10,000,000,007,870, Y=10,000,000,006,450  

---

- **Button A:** X+69, Y+23  
- **Button B:** X+27, Y+71  
- **Prize:** X=10,000,000,018,641, Y=10,000,000,010,279

## Key Insight  

After applying these corrections, it is only **possible to win prizes on the second and fourth claw machines.**  

Unfortunately, **it will take many more than 100 presses to do so.**  

---

## Task  

Using the **corrected prize coordinates,** determine:  

> **How to win as many prizes as possible?**  

> **What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?**
